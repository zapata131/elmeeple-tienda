## 1. UX Audit Methodology

When analyzing a page, feature, or user journey, execute a rigorous audit across the following six dimensions:

### 1.0 Brand Synchronization and Design Doc Alignment (Mandatory Pre-Flight)
Before auditing any component, page, or layout, you **MUST** perform the following alignment checks:
*   **Read DESIGN.md**: Open and read `DESIGN.md` to internalize our current database schemas, page structures, and brand guidelines.
*   **Verify Brand Tokens**: Ensure that any layout proposal, specialty tag, or color accent perfectly matches the official brand tokens defined in `DESIGN.md` (Blanco Roto `#F5F0E9`, Carbón Suave `#3A3A3A`, Malva Suave `#8367C7`, Coral `#FF9E8A`, Turquesa `#73D8D4`).
*   **Technical Feasibility**: Verify that your UI design proposals are fully supported by our schema and session properties documented in `DESIGN.md`. Do not propose mock fields or data flows that contradict our architecture.

### 1.1 Friction and Cognitive Load
*   **Redundancy**: Are we asking the user to type information we already have?
*   **Step Count**: Can we combine steps in a funnel to reduce cognitive strain?
*   **Affordances**: Are interactive elements (buttons, inputs, toggle pills) easily recognizable? Do they have distinct hover, focus, active, and loading states?

### 1.2 Hierarchy and Layout Density
*   **Mobile Adaptability**: Does the layout collapse elegantly on mobile viewports without sacrificing reachability?
*   **Information Scannability**: Is there a clear focal point? Are typography sizes, weights, and letter-spacings structured to guide the eye?
*   **Scroll Fatigue**: On mobile devices, are long scroll grids split using tabs or drawers to keep interactive controls close to the thumb?

### 1.3 Premium Aesthetics and Contrast
*   **Color Harmony**: Are brand colors (Blanco Roto, Carbón Suave, Malva Suave, Coral, Turquesa) used systematically and with purpose?
*   **Emoji Ban**: Are raw emojis strictly prohibited in headers, buttons, cards, and feeds? Are they replaced with custom inline vector SVGs or clean typographic glyphs?
*   **Glassmorphism & Micro-animations**: Do we utilize subtle borders (15%), background opacities (5-10%), and smooth transitions (`duration-200`) to create a premium, tactile feel?

### 1.4 Accessibility and Legibility
*   **Contrast Ratios**: Do text colors against backgrounds satisfy WCAG 2.2 AA (4.5:1) or AAA (7:1) contrast standards?
*   **Touch Targets**: Are all interactive buttons on mobile at least `44x44px` with adequate spacing to prevent accidental clicks?

### 1.5 Conversational Voice
*   **Tone of Voice**: Is the copy warm, direct, and user-centric (following the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide)?
*   **Active Voice**: Address the user in the second person ("you" / "tú"). Explain backend achievements in a comforting, human way instead of exposing technical database jargon.
*   **Casing Consistency**: Ensure all page titles, card headers, form labels, and buttons are in beautiful **sentence case**.
